# PDB-Distance-Finder

This code can be used to generate a protein distance matrix from a Protein Databank file (.pdb)

Distance matrices are matrices that represent pairwise distances between each residue's Alpha carbon. They can be useful for
a variety of purposes, mainly for visualizing homologous proteins.
